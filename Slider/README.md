## Appendix

To create a slider using keyframes and animation, you can follow these general steps:
 
 1. Define the slider structure in HTML by creating a container element and adding multiple slide elements within it.

 2. In CSS, set the slider container to have position: relative and the slides to have position: absolute, with width and height properties that match the container dimensions.

3. Use the @keyframes rule to define the animation for each slide, setting up the starting and ending styles for each keyframe.

4. Use the animation property to apply the animation to the slider container or the individual slides, specifying the keyframe name, duration, timing function, and any other desired animation properties.

5. Use JavaScript or CSS to add interactivity to the slider, such as a button or indicator that triggers the animation to switch between slides.
  


       With these steps, you can create a slider that smoothly transitions between slides using animation and keyframes.By adjusting the timing, easing, and other properties of the animation, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the slider to fit your design goals.
